Today I sunset the largest personal project I've ever worked on where I managed research, design, development, devops, marketing, user interviews, and support. 



A year ago, I wrote a goal for myself "To Complete my Vision"

I elaborated further:

> Looking at my Github I see Photography-Stats, Time-Tracker, grumpy-collective, life-experiments, photoventures, photoventures2, phraseaday, winions. 
> Just to name a few. What a bunch of half baked projects with so many lines of code written and hours 
> wasted. I want to see a project through to the end.

I've always been fascinated by color and launched [Seis Colores](https://seis.pointlessprojects.com/). It gained great traction and so I decided to build Photo Palettes so I could explore even more. It was a great adventure. I learned about CIEDE2000, k-means clustering, and color sorting algorithms.


# Lessons learned

- **AI is changing everything** - An app that used to take many months to build can now take days or weeks. What makes a good app and how to stand out has changed. 
- **Building social communities is HARD. ** - Why should the first users stick around? What's in it for them. 
- **Identifying user pain points when you have no users is impossible.** - Think about how many times you've visited a new website. You try it out, something is unintuitive, there's one click too many to get where you want to go, or some weird bug. You've got just a few seconds of patience before leaving. Was this my problem? Was the product offering the problem? 
- **There's an art to designing an app from zero to one.** - Before there's a login page, before there's a home page, before any of that, there's a blank canvas. Without focus, you'll find yourself going both broad - building a theme and going deep - making a particular experience pixel perfect. This lack of focus, results in a never ending series of work. What I've found to be more beneficial is to go broad first and iterate. Build the primitive and then expand on them later.  
- **Building in a saturated market is hard** - Three separate times

# Looking forward

The app lives as a Figma plugin which you can try out [here](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1553603263291862336/photo-palettes). 

You can always see what I'm currently working on ath the top of the [creations page](/creations).
