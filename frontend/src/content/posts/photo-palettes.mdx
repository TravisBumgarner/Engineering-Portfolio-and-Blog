Today I sunset the largest personal project I've ever worked on, one where I managed research, design, development, DevOps, marketing, user interviews, and support.

A year ago, I wrote a goal for myself: **“To complete my vision.”**

I elaborated:

> Looking at my GitHub, I see Photography-Stats, Time-Tracker, grumpy-collective, life-experiments, photoventures, photoventures2, phraseaday, winions - a bunch of [half-baked projects](https://github.com/TravisBumgarner/Project-Graveyard) with over 100,000 lines of code and unfinished ideas. I want to see a project through to the end.

I've always been fascinated by color and launched [Seis Colores](https://seis.pointlessprojects.com/). It gained strong traction, so I decided to build Photo Palettes and explore even further.

# Lessons Learned

- **AI is changing everything.** An app that once took months to build can now take days or weeks. What makes a good app, and how to stand out, has fundamentally changed.
- **Building social communities is hard.** Why should early users stick around? What's in it for them?
- **Identifying user pain points without users is nearly impossible.** Think about how often you've visited a new site. Something feels unintuitive. One click too many. A weird bug. You have seconds of patience before leaving. Was that my issue or was it the product itself?
- **There's an art to going from zero to one.** Before login pages or home screens, there's a blank canvas. Without focus, you go broad and deep at the same time. That leads to endless work. I've found it better to go broad first, build primitives, then iterate.
- **Building in a saturated market is hard.** Over the year, I watched three similar apps launch and gain traction.

# Wins

## Product / Marketing

This project included several firsts for me, including conducting user interviews and integrating Amplitude analytics. I managed and scoped the entire project in Linear, launched it on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/photo-color-palettes), and created an unauthenticated experience so users could try the app without logging in. I also set up automatic social publishing to Twitter, Instagram, and Bluesky.

## Technical

I worked with several new technologies, including FastAPI, Supabase, Heroku, Cloudinary, CapacitorJS, UptimeRobot, and Resend. I also shipped several firsts: sending programmatic emails, implementing a full authentication system, and building a Figma plugin. Finally, I reused the core codebase with minimal changes to launch the iPhone app.

## Design

I went both broad and deep to build a complete theme and polished UI for desktop and mobile, including designing the app icon.

Below are a few examples of experiences I'm especially proud of having the chance to refine.

I learned new systems, made hard architectural decisions, and shipped anyway. The app now lives on as a Figma plugin, which you can try [here](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1553603263291862336/photo-palettes). While the domain won't be renewed and the code repository will be archived, I'm grateful for what I built. Many of the architectural patterns have already gone on to inspire other apps.
