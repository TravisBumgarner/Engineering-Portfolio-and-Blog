Today I sunset the largest personal project I've ever worked on. One where I managed research, design, development, DevOps, marketing, user interviews, and support.

A year ago, I wrote a goal for myself - "**To Complete my Vision**".

I elaborated further:

> Looking at my Github I see Photography-Stats, Time-Tracker, grumpy-collective, life-experiments, photoventures, photoventures2, phraseaday, winions. A bunch of [half-baked projects](https://github.com/TravisBumgarner/Project-Graveyard) with over 100,000 lines of code written and hours wasted. I want to see a project through to the end.

I'd always been fascinated by color and launched [Seis Colores](https://seis.pointlessprojects.com/). It gained strong traction, so I decided to build Photo Palettes to explore even further.


# Lessons Learned

- **AI is changing everything.** An app that once took months to build can now take days or weeks. What makes a good app and how to stand out has changed. I'm still in the process of exploring the implications of this. 
- **Building social communities is hard.** Why should early users stick around? What's in it for them?
- **Identifying user pain points without users is nearly impossible.** Think about how often you've visited a new site. Something feels unintuitive. One click too many. A weird bug. You have seconds of patience before leaving. Was that my issue? Or was it the product itself?
- **There's an art to going from zero to one.** Before login pages or home screens, there's a blank canvas. Without focus, you go broad (minimum app functionality like logins and browsing) and deep (pixel perfection) at the same time. That leads to endless work. I've found it better to go broad first, build primitives, then iterate.
- **Building in a saturated market is hard.** Over the year that I worked on this project, I saw three similar apps launch on Reddit. 

# Wins

## Product / Marketing

This project included several firsts for me, including conducting user interviews and integrating Amplitude analytics. I managed and scoped the entire project in Linear, launched it on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/photo-color-palettes), and created an unauthenticated experience so users could try the app without logging in. I also set up automatic social publishing to Twitter, Instagram, and Bluesky.

## Design

I went both broad and deep to build a complete theme and polished UI for desktop and mobile, including designing the app icon.

Below are a few examples of experiences I'm very proud of having the chance to go deep on.

## Technical 

I worked with several new technologies, including FastAPI, Supabase, Heroku, Cloudinary, CapacitorJS, UptimeRobot, and Resend. I also shipped several firsts: sending programmatic emails, implementing a full authentication system, and building a Figma plugin. Finally, I reused the core codebase with minimal changes to launch the iPhone app.

# Looking forward

The app now lives on as a Figma plugin, which you can try [here](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1553603263291862336/photo-palettes).

You can always see what I'm currently working on at the top of the [Creations page](/creations).
